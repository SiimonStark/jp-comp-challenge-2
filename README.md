## Project title
Static-Comp 2 by Justin Pyktel

## Motivation
As our class assignment we were to construct a website from scratch that matches a static comp. But we were allowed to use whatever content/theme we wanted, as long as it followed the layout.

## Build status
Finished. (Not Perfect)
I need to go back and dry up the code.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with HTML & CSS (and a tiny bit of JS)</b>

## Features
I took full advantage of grid and flex-box to manipulate the page, so that it is more responsive. Using containers to keep everything nice and grouped helped a lot.

## Challenges/Wins
Many challenges!!: I was really happy to get the "Hamburger Menu" up and working, I prolly should have set it to where if the viewport is large that it would move everything over and stay open.

## How to use?
Click 3 Lines icon to Open side-menu.

## Credits
Big thank you to Flex-Box Froggy!!
